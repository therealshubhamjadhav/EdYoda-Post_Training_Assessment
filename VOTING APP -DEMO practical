Assignment : VOTING APP -DEMO practical
Steps
1. go to root (cd /root/ ) 
  [ec2-user@ip-172-31-28-253 ~]$ sudo su root
  [root@ip-172-31-28-253 ec2-user]# ls
  example-voting-app  istio-1.5.2  istio-1.5.2-linux.tar.gz

2. git clone https://github.com/ashishrpandey/example-voting-app

  [root@ip-172-31-28-253 ec2-user]# cd example-voting-app/
  [root@ip-172-31-28-253 example-voting-app]# ls
  architecture.png               docker-compose.yml  MAINTAINERS  worker
  dockercloud.yml                docker-stack.yml    README.md
  docker-compose-javaworker.yml  k8s-specifications  result
  docker-compose-simple.yml      LICENSE             vote

3. go to /root/example-voting-app/k8s-specifications

  [root@ip-172-31-28-253 example-voting-app]# cd k8s-specifications/
  [root@ip-172-31-28-253 k8s-specifications]# ls
  db-deployment.yaml     redis-service.yaml      vote-deployment.yaml
  db-service.yaml        result-deployment.yaml  vote-service.yaml
  redis-deployment.yaml  result-service.yaml     worker-deployment.yaml


4. [root@ip-172-31-28-253 k8s-specifications]# kubectl apply -f .

deployment.apps/db created
service/db created
deployment.apps/redis created
service/redis created
deployment.apps/result created
service/result created
deployment.apps/vote created
service/vote created
deployment.apps/worker created


5. for voting and result pods, Observe that NodePort is assigned.
--> voting : 31000
resulr : 31001


6. take your publicIP (your instance IP) : NodePort â–º open 2 browsers , one for VOTING and one for Results.
--> http://18.138.255.146:31000
http://18.138.255.146:31001


7. try voting and see the results paralelly in results page.
--> observerd votings cats : 25%
Dogs : 75%


8. Now try to delete the Pods one by one (first voting Pod, then worker pod, then db pod) and see what happens to the voting and result app after deleting


[root@ip-172-31-28-253 k8s-specifications]# kubectl get svc
NAME         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
db           ClusterIP   10.105.120.228   <none>        5432/TCP         33m
kubernetes   ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          39m
redis        ClusterIP   10.101.76.212    <none>        6379/TCP         33m
result       NodePort    10.102.224.23    <none>        5001:31001/TCP   33m
vote         NodePort    10.99.110.6      <none>        5000:31000/TCP   33m

[root@ip-172-31-28-253 k8s-specifications]# kubectl delete po vote-94849dc97-r25mx
pod "vote-94849dc97-r25mx" deleted


9. Write your observations in a text file.
Result:
 both applications are working fine. One can vote for only one animal.

10. what happens after db pod deletion. 
  after deleting voting pod both the applications are working fine.
  [root@ip-172-31-28-253 k8s-specifications]# kubectl delete po vote-94849dc97-r25mx
  pod "vote-94849dc97-r25mx" deleted
  
  and one thing I noticed that deleting the db pod is resulting as both the applications are abruptly stopped because it was expecting the input from the db pod

  [root@ip-172-31-28-253 k8s-specifications]# kubectl delete po db-b54cd94f4-zd956
  pod "db-b54cd94f4-zd956" deleted
  
  After deleting DB pod we will lose all the data in that db but the db pod will be restarted because of REPLICASET
but now the result app will not work because it will be expecting the input from the db which has hot deleted and fpr that we have to delete the result app so that it restarts and connect tp new db pod.

  to run the application again. we have to delete the result pod again so that it will create the result service again.
  [root@ip-172-31-28-253 k8s-specifications]# kubectl delete po result-5d57b59f4b-f97d7
  pod "result-5d57b59f4b-f97d7" deleted
